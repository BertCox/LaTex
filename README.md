## Introduction to LaTex
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software. It is based on the idea that it is better to leave document design to document designers, and to let authors get on with writing documents.

## LaTex Distributions
LaTeX is not a stand-alone typesetting program in itself, but document preparation software that runs on top of Donald E. Knuth's TeX typesetting system. TeX distributions usually bundle together all the parts needed for a working TeX system and they generally add to this both configuration and maintenance utilities. Nowadays LaTeX, and many of the packages built on it, form an important component of any major TeX distribution.

Windows:
- [Tex Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [MikTex](https://miktex.org/)

MacOS:
- [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)

You can also use the Tex capabilities of online editors (see next section).

## LaTex Editors

### Online Editors
Online editors are platform-agnostic editors which allows you to write LaTex without the need for installing any specific Tex-software on your computer. It often also features some collaborative functionality.

Online Editors:
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)

### Offline Editors
Offline editors require a Tex distribution. Hence, prior to installing an editor a Tex-distribution needs to be installed!

Popular offline editors are:
 - TeXStudio (Windows only)
 - Texmaker
 - Atom
 - Visual Studio Code
 - TeXnicle (OSX)
 - TeXShop (OSX)
